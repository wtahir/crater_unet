Genration of binary masks and later on, binarization filters applied on pobability maps generated by the unet are provided in jupyter notebook of:
```
maskfrom_json.ipynb
```
This notebook has all the steps from pre-processing of generation of binary masks from annotations (json) and application of binary image filters to extract features from lunar optical images. 

To crop images (size 256x256):
```
crop_image.ipnyb
```
Prepare data for u-net training using:
```
dataPrepare.ipnyb
```
For training and prediction, use the following notebook.
```
trainUnet.ipnyb
```
Model configuration is written in:
```
main.py
```
Model architecture is given in presented in following file. The model is based on u-net written by [Ronneberger et al., 2015] and keras implementation by [https://github.com/zhixuhao]
```
model.py is
