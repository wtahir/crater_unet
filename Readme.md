Genration of binary masks and later on, binarization filters applied on pobability maps generated by the unet are provided in jupyter notebook of:
```
maskfrom_json.ipynb
```
This notebook has all the steps from pre-processing of generation of binary masks from annotations (json) and application of binary image filters to extract features from lunar optical images. 

To crop images of the sizes 256x256.
```
Crop_image.ipnyb
```
DataPrepare.ipnyb is for data preparation for u-net training

Plotting sigmoig_relu.ipnyb are the plotting functions for relu and sigmoid functions

TrainUnet.ipnyb is a jupyter notebook for training and prediction of dataset.

- Main.py is the model configuration

- Model.py is model architecture
